# openidl-main

This is the gh-pages branch.  We use this to manage the github pages documentation for the system.

There are two configurations:
- _config.yml - used by github
- _local_config.yml - used for local development

To work with this locally use:
````bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --config _local_config.yml
````

Prerequisites:
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

WARNING: Jekyll may be difficult to use on windows.
